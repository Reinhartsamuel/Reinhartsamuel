# 👋 Hey, I'm Reinhart!

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in backend systems, smart contracts, and high-frequency trading infrastructure. Currently building **byScript.io**, an algorithmic trading platform that removes emotion from trading. Connect your CEX accounts and integrate strategy.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🧪 **Product Hacking**
  Fast prototyping for real users. Hackathon alum. User-focused, but allergic to bloated frontends.

- ⚙️ **Backend & Systems**
  Crafting scalable APIs, trading bots, and complex strategy automation pipelines. Strong preference for Node.js, PostgreSQL (JSONB, full-text), Redis, and serverless infra.

- 🔐 **Smart Contracts**
  Writing and auditing Solidity contracts with a focus on safety, minimalism, and permissionless logic. Tooling: Foundry, Ethers.js, Viem, Anvil.

- 🧬 **DeFi Engineering**
  Deep into protocol integrations (Uniswap, Aave, Balancer), custom strategy vaults, and Merkle-proof-based on-chain authorization.
