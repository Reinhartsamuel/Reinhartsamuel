# 👋 Hey, I'm Reinhart!

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in backend systems, smart contracts, and high-frequency trading infrastructure. Currently building **Tweetonium**, a web3-native platform that bridges creators and NFTs through social-first experiences.

## 🧠 What I Do

- ⚙️ **Backend & Systems**
  Crafting scalable APIs, trading bots, and complex strategy automation pipelines. Strong preference for Node.js, PostgreSQL (JSONB, full-text), Redis, and serverless infra.

- 🔐 **Smart Contracts**
  Writing and auditing Solidity contracts with a focus on safety, minimalism, and permissionless logic. Tooling: Foundry, Ethers.js, Viem, Anvil.

- 🧬 **DeFi Engineering**
  Deep into protocol integrations (Uniswap, Aave, Balancer), custom strategy vaults, and Merkle-proof-based on-chain authorization.

- 🧪 **Product Hacking**
  Fast prototyping for real users. Hackathon alum. User-focused, but allergic to bloated frontends.

## ⚡️ Projects

### 🐦 Tweetonium
> NFT minting via Twitter. For creators. No wallets needed.
- Mention bot listener that triggers web3 actions
- Custodial wallet infra
- Mint-on-mention + revenue sharing logic
- Built with Firestore (migrating to Postgres), Cloud Functions, and Solidity

### 🧠 Strategy Vault Factory
> On-chain vaults authorized via signed Merkle roots
- Permissionless vault instantiation with signature verification
- Off-chain strategy DB + Merkle proof generator
- Full on-chain execution authorization via pre-signed hashes
